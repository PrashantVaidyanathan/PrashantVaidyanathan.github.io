I'm a Group Lead at [Oxford Biomedica](http://oxb.com) focussing on data architecture and standardization for biological and experimental data. I'm currently working on creating an ecosystem to facilitate FAIR data accross the entire organization. Before this, I worked as a Senior Researcher in the [Health Intelligence Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/health-intelligence/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) where I developed frameworks to help build and understand gene networks in Synthetic Biology.

I received my PhD in Computer Engineering from Boston University in 2019. I was part of the Cross-Disciplinary Integration of Design Automation Research ([CIDAR](http://cidarlab.org/)) Lab and worked under [Prof. Douglas Densmore (PhD)](http://cidarlab.org/doug-densmore/). My PhD Dissertation - "Functional Synthesis of Genetic Systems" focussed on developing computational and mathematical frameworks for the synthesis and design of genetic circuits.

I also recieved an MS degree in Computer Engineering from Boston University, Boston, MA, USA in 2014, and a BE (Hons.) degree in Electrical and Electronics engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in 2012.
