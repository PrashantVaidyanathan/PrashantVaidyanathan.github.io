abstract: Digital electronic circuits have inspired synthetic biologists to program living cells with synthetic decision-making circuits by creating multilevel genetic logic gates. In both genetic and electronic circuits, logic synthesis translates an abstract functional description into a representation that can be physically implemented. However, inherent differences in genetic logic devices present new synthesis challenges. Here we provide a starting point for a growing set of biodesign automation tools to tackle this challenge in a unified way. This framework will enable direct comparison of new approaches, results that are transferable and standardized, and research into independent areas of the problem formulation with a clear path toward future integration.
