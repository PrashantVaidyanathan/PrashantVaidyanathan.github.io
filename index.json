However, our ability to accurately predict this dynamic behavior is limited by our quantitative understanding of the circuits being constructed. This understanding can be represented as a mathematical model, which can be used to optimize circuit performance and inform the design of future circuits. Previous inference methods have used fluorescent reporters to quantify average behaviors over an extended time window, resulting in a static characterization which is a poor predictor of dynamics. Here we present a method for characterizing the dynamic behavior of synthetic gene circuits. The method relies on parameter inference techniques applied to time-series measurements of cell cultures growing in microtiter plates. We use our method to design and characterize gene circuits in E. coli that provide core functionality for engineering cell behavior at the population level. We arrange 23 biological parts into 9 devices and combine them to construct and measure 9 gene circuits including relays, receivers and a degrader. We demonstrate that the behaviors of simple devices can be modeled dynamically and used to predict the behaviors of more complex circuits. Furthermore, our method allows incremental inference of models as new circuits are constructed, and lays the foundation for iteratively learning dynamic models from data in a scalable manner.","tags":[],"title":"Scalable dynamic characterization of synthetic gene circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prashant Vaidyanathan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548374400,"objectID":"1a0d495537dfaebb4468e692cfa46898","permalink":"/publication/phdthesis/","publishdate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phdthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic genetic regulatory networks (or genetic circuits) can operate in complex biochemical environments to process and manipulate biological information to produce a desired behavior. The ability to engineer such genetic circuits has wide-ranging applications in various fields such as therapeutics, energy, agriculture, and environmental remediation. However, engineering multilevel genetic circuits quickly and reliably is a big challenge in the field of synthetic biology. This difficulty can partly be attributed to the growing complexity of biology. But some of the predominant challenges include the absence of formal specifications -- that describe precise desired behavior of these biological systems, as well as a lack of computational and mathematical frameworks -- that enable rapid in-silico design and synthesis of genetic circuits. This thesis introduces two major frameworks to reliably design genetic circuits. The first implementation focuses on a framework that enables synthetic biologists to encode Boolean logic functions into living cells. Using high-level hardware description language to specify the desired behavior of a genetic logic circuit, this framework describes how, given a library of genetic gates, logic synthesis can be applied to synthesize a multilevel genetic circuit, while accounting for biological constraints such as 'signal matching', 'crosstalk', and 'genetic context effects'. This framework has been implemented in a tool called Cello, which was applied to design 60 circuits for Escherichia coli, where the circuit function was specified using Verilog code and transformed to a DNA sequence. Across all these circuits, 92% of the output states functioned as predicted. The second implementation focuses on a framework to design complex genetic systems where the focus is on how the system behaves over time instead of its behavior at steady-state. Using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) -- a formalism used to specify properties of dense-time real-valued signals, biologists can specify very precise temporal behaviors of a genetic system. The framework describes how genetic circuits that are built from a well characterized library of DNA parts, can be scored by quantifying the 'degree of robustness' of in-silico simulations against an STL formula. Using formal verification, experimental data can be used to validate these in-silico designs. In this framework, the design space is also explored to predict external controls (such as approximate small molecule concentrations) that might be required to achieve a desired temporal behavior. This framework has been implemented in a tool called Phoenix.","tags":[],"title":"Functional synthesis of genetic systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Curtis Madsen","Prashant Vaidyanathan","Sadra Sadraddini","Cristian-Ioan Vasile","Nicholas A.

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522368000,"objectID":"53879ef8f1654f03848764606a4962a8","permalink":"/project/stlmetrics/","publishdate":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stlmetrics/","section":"project","summary":"A metric to compute the distance between two bounded Signal Temporal Logic formulas","tags":["Formal Methods"],"title":"STL Metrics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prashant Vaidyanathan","Rachael Ivison","Giuseppe Bombara","Nicholas A.
